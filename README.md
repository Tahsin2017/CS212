# CS212

All the projects are done during the coursework of CS212 under professor Kenneth Lord in CUNY Queens College. The course name is Object-Oriented Programming in Java.

The lab homeworks were done under instruction of Cong Cheng. They were mainly targeted to learn problem solving. So, runtime was not considered during doing those homeworks.
